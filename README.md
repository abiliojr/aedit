# History of this code

In the early 2000s, while still being a teenager, I was an avid user of Aedit under DOS. It was fast and powerful, and I had been using it since I was a kid.

Sadly, it was not able to handle long file names nor had any integration with the Windows clipboard (two features I wanted). Looking around for solutions, I stumbled upon a [website](http://martin.zutphen.nu/aedit/) of a gentleman that had written to Intel and got authorization to use Aedit however he saw fit.

Inspired by his story, I decided to write Intel to ask for the source code of the editor, which they provided as seen on the initial commit of this repo. I was surprised to find it written in PL/M, and not having access to PL/M 86, my teenage idea of adding features to it was put on a very long hold.

Sometime later I rediscovered the Zip file with the source code, and decided to write to Martin Meijerink again to offer him the file, as at least he had a website about it. He accepted it and posted it with a note.

Sadly, the original mails got lost (my mail inbox size back then was 1 Mb, and I'm unable to find any backups), so I reproduce here the story as faithful as possible.

# Current status

There is an [ongoing effort to port this code to C](https://github.com/ogdenpm/aedit-c). All the initial translation was done by the mighty Mark Ogden.
