This file describes how to generate Aedit for iRMX I and II.

To generate Aedit for iRMX I:

	submit aedgen86(sys_dir, version_char)

To generate Aedit for iRMX II:

	submit aedgen(sys_dir, version_char)

where: start_dir is the pathname to the system library directory.
                 Something like :sd:rmx286/ is what is expected.
                 Notice the trailing '/' in the pathname.
       version_char is 'x' if an internal version is to be generated or
                    is 'v' if a release version is to be generated.


A utility, PEXN, is invoked to make the external declaration include
file for Aedit.  This utility only runs on iRMX II so both the iRMX I and
II versions of Aedit must be generated on iRMX II.
