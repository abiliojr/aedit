   This file lists and summarizes the macros in the file USEFUL.MAC.

NOTES:

--To activate the macros, type: M(acro) G(et) USEFUL.MAC.  

--These macros occupy about 1900 bytes of the macro buffer.  The default,
  3072, leaves you enough room to add more macros.  

--The macro uses the N7, N8, and N9 N-variables only.  All other
  N-variables are not affected and can be used freely throughout the rest
  of the AEDIT session.  

--The macro uses the S9 S-variables only.  All other S-variables are not
  affected and can be used freely throughout the rest of the AEDIT
  session.  

--Some macros use the SET command to change the value of some AEDIT
  features (e.g., changing the setting of K_token and Radix).  

--You can modify the file and the macros so they will fit you best.  In
  particular, you can create synonyms for useful macros, e.g.,
  M\010\BRe+B\NL\MM ==> so <CTRL-P> works as +B.  


List of Macros:

<BL>: Use blank in addition to tab.

.   : Find the next occurrence of the last target string.
,   : Find the previous occurrence of the last target string.

L   : Convert the character under the cursor to lowercase.
U   : Convert the character under the cursor to uppercase.
_   : Convert the word beginning at the cursor location to lowercase.
^   : Convert the word beginning at the cursor location to uppercase.

<CTRL-W>:
      Advance cursor to the next word.
<CTRL-K>:
      Advance cursor to the previous word.

]   : Scroll left 1 position.
[   : Scroll right 1 position.
}   : Scroll left 3 positions.
{   : Scroll right 3 positions.


+W  : Skip forward while white spaces.
+N  : Skip forward while non-white spaces.
+B  : Skip forward while blanks.

-W  : Skip backward while white spaces.
-N  : Skip backward while non-white spaces.
-B  : Skip backward while blanks.

DT  : Insert date in mmm dd, yyyy format (e.g., July 24, 1984)
DM  : Insert date in dd-mmm-yyyy  format (e.g.,  24-Jul-1984 )
      Dates are as returned by the UDI DqGetTime procedure.

<CTRL-B>:
      Insert the Block Buffer into the text.

PG  : Page the text. Header is always "Heading".
PP  : Page the text. Header is as given in the S9 S-variable.
      The macros try, when possible, to put headers in empty lines.
      The macros use Tag C and Tag D for internal computations.

CNTR: Center the current line.

DETAB:
      Convert all tabs to blanks.

ENTAB:
      Convert all blanks to tabs.             (works very slowly)

SHL : Display current line number.
SFL : Display number of lines in file.
SFC : Display number of characters in file.
SHP : Display current position in line.

<MEXEC>C:

      On-line calculator.  Enter an expression; press <MEXEC>C at its
      right side.  The result is written, and you can continue with
      additional calculations.

SMP : Set the margins to be the same as those of the paragraph the
      cursor is in.

NUM : Insert line number prefix to each line in a text file.
      The macro uses Tag D for internal computations.

0   : Set margins- indent=0, left=0, right=70
2   : Set margins- indent=0, left=3, right=70
3   : Set margins- indent=3, left=3, right=70
4   : Set margins- indent=3, left=5, right=70
5   : Set margins- indent=5, left=5, right=70
6   : Set margins- indent=5, left=7, right=70
7   : Set margins- indent=7, left=7, right=70
